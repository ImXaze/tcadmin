Shared Dependencies:

1. **Data Schemas**: Both files will likely share a data schema related to system usage statistics (Memory Usage, CPU Usage, Bandwidth Usage, Player Count). This could be named "SystemUsageStats".

2. **Exported Variables**: Both files may need to access the current system usage statistics. These could be exported as variables such as "currentMemoryUsage", "currentCPUUsage", "currentBandwidthUsage", and "currentPlayerCount".

3. **DOM Element IDs**: Both files will need to reference the console iframe, which could have an ID of "consoleIframe". The knowledge base button will also need an ID, such as "knowledgeBaseButton".

4. **Message Names**: If the system usage statistics are updated in real-time, there may be messages sent between the files to trigger updates. These could be named "updateMemoryUsage", "updateCPUUsage", "updateBandwidthUsage", and "updatePlayerCount".

5. **Function Names**: Functions to update the system usage statistics could be named "updateMemoryUsage()", "updateCPUUsage()", "updateBandwidthUsage()", and "updatePlayerCount()". There may also be a function to open the knowledge base, such as "openKnowledgeBase()".
